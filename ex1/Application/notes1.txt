Port B SPI
Port D USART1
Port H USART2
Port J USART3
every USART can operate also in SPI mode
==============================

UDRn – USART I/O Data Register n
transmit buffer can only be written when the UDREn Flag in the UCSRnA Register is set.
do not use Read-Modify-Write instructions (SBI and CBI) on this location. Be careful when using bit test instructions (SBIC and SBIS), since these also will change the state of the FIFO.

UCSRnA – USART Control and Status Register A
7 - receive complete
6 - transmit complete
5- data register empty
4 - frame error
3 data overrun
2 - parity error
1 - double transmission speed
0 -
